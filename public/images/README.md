# Image Assets for Mon P'tit Poulet

This directory contains all the image assets for the Mon P'tit Poulet application.

## Directory Structure

- `/logos` - Contains brand logos and icons
- `/menu` - Contains food product images
- `/ui` - Contains UI elements and decorative images

## Adding Images Post-Build

You can add or replace images even after the application is built:

1. Simply add your new images to the appropriate folder
2. Make sure the filenames match what's referenced in the code
3. No rebuild is required for image changes

## Image Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all filenames (e.g., `main-logo.png`)
- Use descriptive names that indicate the content
- Include image dimensions in the filename for UI elements (e.g., `hero-banner-1200x600.jpg`)
